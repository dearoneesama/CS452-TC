***** IMPORTANT *****
=====================

The setupTFTP.sh script does not provide any protection, i.e., students can
potentially overwrite each other's binaries!  Please only run the script
after you have verified that no other user uses that particular RPi.

Also, please do not tinker with the 'public' directories in /u/cs/452/public
directly.  This might leave the TFTP load process unusable, which might be a
problem outside regular business hours.


Build and Run (linux.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca)
=============

git clone --recurse-submodules https://git.uwaterloo.ca/jx3yang/cs452-project
cd CS452-Project
make

To run unit tests
=================
cd unittesting
make run

# reboot RPi
